Creating a tech blog is extremely easy to do if you use some common tools that are available for free. This (my first) post describes how I setup this blog in a few hours for practically no cost.

You can find the source code to this blog at my GitHub profile here.
Why?

Basically, I decided to start a tech blog a while back. I have used these type of blogs since I started software development to learn. Also, I figure it would be nice to have a place on the internet where I can put ideas, my resume, some projects I work on, and just give some basic information about me.

So, I decided to create the site you are reading today. I don't know how interesting it will be, but hopefully it will give me the opportunity to learn.

Technologies

For the most part, the technology stack was pretty obvious for me.

GitHub

When I was starting this project, I wanted to make sure that everything I was doing was available to anyone who was interested. And in this day and age, that means hosting the source code on GitHub. So my first decision was easy, host the source code on GitHub.

Getting started with GitHub is mostly just a matter of going to the site, setting up an account and creating a repository.

GitHub Pages

And since I have had a good deal of experience with GitHub Pages, I decided it would be really easy to just use GitHub's "built-in" utility for hosting "static" web pages.

Setting up GitHub Pages is a pretty simple conventioned based approach, basically I just had to name the repository that I created appropriately. See more information about this at their site.
